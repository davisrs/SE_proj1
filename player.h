		//see handout
		//1. a default constructor that creates a null player with name “none” and type
		//	“empty”. Remember that the default constructor also needs to initialize any other
		//	data members that the Player has.
		//2. an overloaded constructor that has two arguments: its name and type.
		//3. a destructor that recycles any memory that was allocated to the object
		//4. a method void display_name () displays the player’s name
		//5. a method <type> getName () that returns the player’s name – the return type will
		//depend on how you have designed the class
		//6. a method <type> getType () that returns the player’s type – the return type will
		//	depend on how you have designed the class
		//7. a method display_me() that displays the player’s name and type
		//8. an overloaded assignment operator for the class Player
